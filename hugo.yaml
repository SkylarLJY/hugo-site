    content: |-
      I'm a Toronto-based software developer with an interest in functional programming, Scala and writing clean code. 
      
      I enjoy learning new topics and sharing my learning along the way. When I'm not in front of a computer coding, you'll find me sniffing beans in coffee shops around the city, listening to a 3h long podcast, or reading about how to make sourdough bread.
